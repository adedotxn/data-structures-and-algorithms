# Graph

A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of a finite number of vertices (a.k.a nodes) connected by edges.
Trees are a specific type of graph data structure.

There is no hierarchy in graphs (doesn't have to be read/represented top-down)

## Types
- **Directed** - a graph in which the edges have a direction. Edges are usually represented by arrows pointing in the direction the graph can be traversed.

- **Undirected** - Edges are bidirectional and can be traversed in either direction.
