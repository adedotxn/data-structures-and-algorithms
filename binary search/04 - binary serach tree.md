think of a tree, with branches and dub branches and leaves
                          A
                     B         C   
                    /           \
                 D    E       F    G

 B --> D, E , left sub tree. C --> F,G right sub tree

 A = root/parent;  B = left child ; C = right child ; D & E, F & G = siblings; D,E,F,G = leaf
 leaf nodes -- end of the the tree that has no children


Binary tree can only have two branches for every node
Binary search trees are ordered, each subtree is usually less than or equal to it's parent node
each right subtree is greater than or equal to the parent node
