# Tree

A tree is a **hierachical data structure** that **consists of nodes connected by edges**. It as **a non linear data structure** compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures

In linear data structures, the time required to search is proportional to the size of the data set but in Trees, owing to it's non-linear nature, allow quicker and easier access to data.

A tree willnot contain any loop or cycles

## Applications/Usage
- DOM
- File systems for directory structure
- Chatbots

# Binary Tree
A binary tree is **a tree DS in which each node has at most two children**, referred to as left child and right child

# Binary Search Tree
A binary search tree is a binary tree that maintains that :
- The value of each left node must be smaller than the value of it's parent node.
- The value of each right node must be greater than the value of it's parent node.
- Each node must have 2 children.

# Binary Search Tree Operations
- Insertion : to add a node to the tree.
- Search : to find a node given it's value.
- Depth First Search and Breadth First Search : to visit all nodes in the tree.
- Deletion : to remove a node given it's value.

# Binary Search Tree Applications/Usage
- Searching, Sorting.
- Implement ADT (abstract data types) such as lookup tables and priority queues.
