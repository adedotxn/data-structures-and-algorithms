# Hash Table (a.k.a Hash Map)
A hash table is a data structure used to store key-value pairs.

Hash table is a data structure which stores data in an associative manner. In a hash table, data is stored in an array format where each data value has it's own unique index value. Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data
